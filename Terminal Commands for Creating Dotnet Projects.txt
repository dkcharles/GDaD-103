Link to the C# repository version of RayLib https://github.com/chrisdill/raylib-cs (note that the standard library uses C++).

Create a 8.0 dotnet project running the following command in a Windows Terminal or PowerShell (make sure that the Terminal is in the correct folder): 

	dotnet new console

For RayLib, though, you need to create a dotnet 6.0 project with a main project visible:

	dotnet new console --framework net6.0 --use-program-main

Then for Raylib you need to add its game library files by runnning the follwoing from a terminal in teh same folder as the dotnet project:

	dotnet add package Raylib-cs
